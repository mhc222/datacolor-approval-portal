# Datacolor Spyder Social Media Playbook

## Brand Voice
- **Tone**: Expert but approachable, helpful not salesy, passionate about color accuracy
- **Personality**: The knowledgeable friend who happens to be a color science expert
- **Avoid**: Jargon without explanation, talking down to beginners, aggressive selling

## Content Pillars (stick to these ratios)
- Color Education (40%): Tips, tutorials, "did you know", myth-busting
- Product Value (25%): Features, use cases, customer results (not specs)
- Community (20%): User work, behind-the-scenes, photographer stories
- Industry News (15%): Trends, new tech, creative inspiration

## Platform Rules

### Instagram
- Carousel posts get 3x engagement - use for tutorials
- First slide = hook, must stop the scroll
- 3-5 hashtags max (mix of broad + niche)
- Best times: Tue-Fri, 11am-1pm, 7-9pm
- Reels outperform static for reach

### Twitter/X
- 280 chars but 70-100 performs best
- Threads for education (5-8 tweets)
- Visual tweets get 150% more retweets
- Engage in replies, quote tweet industry news
- Best times: Tue-Thu, 9-11am

### Facebook
- Longer form OK (but front-load the hook)
- Native video > YouTube links
- Questions drive comments
- Best times: Tue-Fri, 9am-1pm

## Post Formulas That Work

### PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)
"Your prints don't match your screen? [Problem] You've wasted hours tweaking settings and money on reprints. [Agitate] Monitor calibration takes 5 minutes and fixes this forever. [Solution]"

### Before/After
Show the transformation. Uncalibrated vs calibrated. Amateur vs pro result.

### Myth Buster
"MYTH: Factory calibration is good enough. TRUTH: Monitors drift 2-5% monthly..."

### Quick Tip
"Pro tip: Calibrate in the lighting you actually edit in. That sunny window? Close the blinds first."

### Behind the Scenes
Show real photographers using Spyder. Messy desks welcome.

## Hooks That Stop the Scroll
- Question: "Can you spot what's wrong with this photo?"
- Statistic: "73% of photographers have never calibrated..."
- Controversial: "Expensive monitors are a waste of money (if you skip this step)"
- Story: "A wedding photographer called us in tears..."
- Challenge: "Take this 10-second color accuracy test"

## CTAs by Goal
- **Engagement**: "Drop a 🎨 if you've been there"
- **Save**: "Save this for your next editing session"
- **Share**: "Tag a photographer who needs to see this"
- **Click**: "Link in bio for the full guide"
- **Subtle sell**: "See why 2M photographers trust Spyder"

## Content Mix (weekly)
- 2 educational posts
- 1 product-adjacent post (not hard sell)
- 1 community/UGC post
- 1 engagement post (poll, question, hot take)
- 1-2 stories/ephemeral content

## What NOT to Post
- Spec sheets as graphics
- "Buy now" without value
- Stock photos (ever)
- Responding to competitors directly
- Unedited AI images
- Politics, religion, controversy outside color science
